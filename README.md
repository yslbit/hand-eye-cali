# Hand-Eye Calibration System

A hand-eye calibration system based on FastAPI + Gradio, supporting automatic sampling, image stream, error visualization, and nonlinear optimization.
## Features.

   - Supports ZED camera image acquisition and AprilTag pose estimation

   - Supports robot control (e.g., Aubo) and pose sampling

   - Supports sample selection based on optical axis angle, distance, and translation constraints

   - Supports Spectral/KMeans clustering and nonlinear optimization

   - Supports Web UI (Gradio) and API calls (FastAPI)

## Quick Start

bash run.bash
